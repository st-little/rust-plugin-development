# Rust plugin development

Develop plugins using [OxideMod](https://docs.oxidemod.com/).

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A lightweight but powerful source code editor by Microsoft.
- [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers): The Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment.
